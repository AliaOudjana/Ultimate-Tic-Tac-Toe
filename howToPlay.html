        <p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a more strategic version of Tic-Tac-Toe that allows players to engage in a more dynamic gameplay.</p>
        <p>Whichever square that the first player places in a small Tic-Tac-Toe, determines which square of the large Tic-Tac-Toe the next player gets to place their shape at.</p>

        <p>Should that particular small Tic-Tac-Toe be occupied already, the player that was sent there can choose to place their shape at any available spot in the larger space.</p>

        <p>The player who gets three in a row for that small Tic-Tac-Toe wins the square.</p>

        <p>Should a draw be achieved in that small Tic-Tac-Toe, that square is considered wasted and remains at a draw.</p>

        <p>To win the game, you have to complete the large Tic-Tac-Toe with 3 in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</p>
